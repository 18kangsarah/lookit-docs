Welcome! Here you will find detailed information about how to design and run online research studies with families on Lookit.

If you're new to Lookit, the best way to get up to speed quickly is to work through the :ref:`tutorial<Tutorial>`.

.. admonition:: Can I use it yet?

   Yes! Please see `the wiki <https://github.com/lookit/research-resources/wiki>`_ for information about how to set up your access agreement and IRB protocol.
