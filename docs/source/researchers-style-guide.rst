Style guide
##################################

We try to conform to some common stylistic and writing guidelines to provide a familiar and friendly experience across Lookit studies.

========================
General language usage
========================

1. Use casual language and terms where possible

   * "Baby" rather than "infant" (they mean the same thing, but "baby" is far more common in everyday speech; "infant" is more common in clinical/academic settings)
   
   * "Newborn" rather than "neonate"
   
   * Referring to the parent/guardian can be tricky since they may or may not be a "Mom" or "Dad" - "grown-up" works well in most cases

2. Use singular "they" rather than "he/she" or "(s)he" or "the child." (E.g., say "Hold your child so they can see the screen" rather than "Hold your child so he/she can see the screen.") It's common enough now that it's more readable, plus it encompasses families who use pronouns other than he/she. 

3. A girl is a female child. If you're talking about a female grown-up--e.g., a video is going to show your RA demonstrating a toy--that's a woman. (You can consider words like "person," "somebody", or "friend" if that sounds awkward!)

==========================
Study purpose
==========================

The :ref:`study purpose<purpose>` is the most challenging piece of the study to write for most researchers (yes, including all that JSON!). The big questions to consider are:

1. Is this an ACCURATE description of the question the study will answer? I.e. when we get the data, is it at least possible that we will be able to answer it? Often we see descriptions of a broad research program, instead of the particular question THIS study will address. 
   
   Examples of questions your study does not answer because they are way too broad: "How do children learn language?," "How do babies think about morality?," "How does numerical cognition develop?"
   
2. Does it explain why this question matters or why this question is interesting? This doesn't need to be a "practical" reason like informing parenting or education practices - basic research matters! Here are a few common framings that do NOT explain why a question matters:

   - Not much is known about X.
   - X is an important skill for doing Y and Z, so we're interested in whether babies can do X / how babies learn to do X.
   
   However, you don't have to justify the entire field of cognitive science/psychology. E.g., if your question would distinguish between there being two separate systems for representing number that kids have to link, and there only being one, you're set. Distinguishing between competing theories and determining whether things are innate are generally ok places to stop. 

Examples coming soon of good "purpose" sections and before/after revisions!
